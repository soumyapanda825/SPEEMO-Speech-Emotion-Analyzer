# SPEEMO-Speech-Emotion-Analyzer
Used RAVDESS dataset which included around 1500 audio files from 24 different actors to analyze emotions they represent Used dataset SAVEE which further had 500 audio files recorded by 4 different male actors Extracted the features from the audio files using LibROSA library in Python for audio analysis The model predicted the gender of the speaker with 100% accuracy It predicted the emotion of the speaker using 70% accuracy Accuracy can be improved by using more audio files for training


Currently, I have replaced the SAVEE dataset with the TESS audio library and working to achieve better results.

I am also working on a live audio receiver which can record voice and give Gender and Emotion as an output
